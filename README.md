Cavarretta F (2025) *A mathematical model for data-driven synthesis of neuron morphologies based on random walks.* **Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics** 11:1632271. doi: 10.3389/fams.2025.1632271 

The authors used the equations in this work to implement a Python package that enables estimation of distance-dependent bifurcation and annihilation rates from reconstructed neuron morphology statistics [Visit the Repository](https://github.com/fcavarretta-ualr/morphgen-rates).
