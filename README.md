## Abstract

Large-scale, biophysically detailed brain models require many 3D neuron morphologies with realistic cell-to-cell variability, but experimental reconstructions can be scarce. This work extends a branching-and-annihilating random-walk approach by deriving equations that estimate branching and annihilation probabilities directly from commonly reported summary metrics such as Sholl plots and branch-point counts. This enables realistic morphology generation even when full experimental reconstructions are unavailable. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
